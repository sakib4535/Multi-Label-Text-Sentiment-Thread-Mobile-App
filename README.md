# "Multi-Label Text Sentiment Classification and Word Embedding Analysis for the Review of 'Thread' Social Media Application,"

🌟 **Project Highlights:**

📢 Comprehensive Dataset: With over 37,000 reviews, our meticulously curated dataset captures a substantial and representative sample of user feedback from both Android and iOS platforms, offering a comprehensive view of the "Thread" app's reception.

💬 Rich Textual Data: Each review is accompanied by its corresponding textual content, enabling us to explore the intricacies of user language, writing styles, and expressions of sentiment.

⭐ Sentiment Analysis: We've developed a multi-label text sentiment classification model to categorize user sentiments into positive, negative, or neutral. The analysis provides invaluable insights into user satisfaction, app usability, feature preferences, and potential areas for improvement.

🪶 Word Embedding with Word2Vec: Leveraging Word2Vec, we've performed word embedding analysis, transforming text data into dense vector representations. This enables advanced Natural Language Processing tasks and helps extract meaningful patterns and trends.

🎯 **Highlights:**
- We trained a powerful sentiment classification model using Word2Vec, enabling us to classify app reviews as Positive, Negative, or Neutral with exceptional accuracy.

- Label-wise accuracies are impressive, with Positive Sentiment at 88.25%, Negative Sentiment at 98.20%, and Neutral Sentiment at 91.00%.

- The mean accuracy of 92.48% reflects the model's strong performance across all categories.

📈 **Performance Metrics:**
- Accuracy Rate: An impressive 79.90% indicates that most reviews are correctly classified into their sentiment categories.

- Precision of 94.06%: When our model predicts a sentiment label, it's correct nearly 95% of the time.

- A remarkable Recall of 91.77% means our model effectively captures actual positive reviews.

💡 Insights:
Our project demonstrates how advanced natural language processing techniques can enhance sentiment analysis. This has practical applications for social media monitoring, customer feedback analysis, and more.
